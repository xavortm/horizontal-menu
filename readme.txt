No, when you activate the plugin, you will get the change of the menu position applied only to your user. All other users will get a notification at the top of the screen, that they can activate it too.

= How to disable the menu without disabling the plugin? =

Since it's a per-user setting, we've placed the option in the user settings page. Just go to your profile in the WordPress Dashboard and uncheck the horizontal menu setting located near the end of the page.
