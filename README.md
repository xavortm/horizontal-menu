# Horizontal Menu

Transform the standard vertical WordPress admin dashboard menu into responsive horizontal one, that scales depending on your viewport, hiding extra menu items in a "show more" megamenu dropdown view. Using this plugin you can have as many menu items as you want in a single view, without the need of scrolling or hovering over the menu items one by one.

All menu items in the dropdown are opened, so you can easily scan the menu items and pick the one you need.
